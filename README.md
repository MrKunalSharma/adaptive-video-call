‚ú® Features
Room-based Video Calling
Secure Room Creation: Generate unique room IDs with UUID-based identification
Simple Room Joining: Join existing rooms via shareable room IDs
Multi-participant Support: Designed for scalable peer connections
Connection Status Monitoring: Real-time updates on connection states
Network-Aware Optimization
Dynamic Quality Adjustment: Automatically scales video quality from 360p to 4K
Bandwidth Monitoring: Continuously measures available bandwidth
Predictive Adaptation: Anticipates network changes before they impact the call
Custom ML Algorithm: Trained on diverse network condition datasets
Real-time Statistics
Comprehensive Metrics: Monitors bandwidth, throughput, latency, jitter, and packet loss
Visual Indicators: Color-coded quality indicators and progress bars
Historical Tracking: Logs network conditions throughout the call
Performance Scoring: Quantifies connection quality on a 0-100 scale
Auto Recovery
Connection Resilience: Automatically recovers from temporary disconnections
ICE Restart Capability: Implements ICE restarts when connections fail
STUN/TURN Fallbacks: Uses TURN servers when direct connections aren't possible
State Preservation: Maintains call state during reconnection attempts
Cross-platform Support
Browser Compatibility: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
Responsive Design: Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
No Installation Required: Pure web-based implementation
Progressive Enhancement: Gracefully degrades on limited devices
üèóÔ∏è Architecture
System Architecture

The application follows a hybrid architecture with these key components:

Client-Side Components
WebRTC Engine: Manages peer connections, media streams, and data channels
Signaling Client: Handles WebSocket communication for connection establishment
Network Monitor: Collects and analyzes real-time network statistics
Adaptive Quality Controller: Implements quality adjustment decisions
UI Components: Provides intuitive user interface for call management
Server-Side Components
Flask Web Server: Serves the application and REST API endpoints
WebSocket Signaling Server: Facilitates peer discovery and connection
Room Manager: Handles room creation, joining, and participant tracking
TensorFlow Prediction Service: Hosts the ML model for network optimization
Network Optimizer: Processes network statistics and generates recommendations
Data Flow
Client establishes WebSocket connection to the signaling server
Room creation/joining occurs through the signaling channel
WebRTC peer connection established with ICE candidates exchange
Media streams are connected directly between peers (P2P)
Network statistics are continuously monitored and sent to the server
ML model processes statistics and returns optimization recommendations
Client adjusts video quality parameters based on recommendations
